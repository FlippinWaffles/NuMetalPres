# NuMetalPres
A way for all of us to collab at nu-metal-preservation.com, and make things flow easier!

A few basic stupid rules to make sure everyone understands what this really is

1. This isn't a request page, I understand its tempting to ask for this album or that album. That isn't what this is for. I'll be closing those asap
2. This is a page for sharing information, Use the "issues" tab and write up your info. Please use the same thread for the same band, No reason to have 30 slipknot threads
3. Please tag accordingly! If there is an error in the site (which happens!) please still post on here and use the error tag so we can address it asap.
4. You have to sign up for an account through github to have the ability to post here
5. Have fun!

All donations will be used to fund us buying more cds/tapes!
